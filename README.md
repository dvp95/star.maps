# star.maps

## What is this?

This project is my attempt at creating star maps using Python and [Summer He's tutorial on Medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-use-python-to-create-custom-star-maps-for-your-next-stargazing-journey-9908b421f30e)

### What are my own goals?

1. Re-do this tutorial so it's not in a Jupyter notebook. :white_check_mark:
2. Add user input functionality for location and time. 	:white_check_mark:
3. Create a 24 hr animation of a star map based on the given location and timezone. :white_check_mark:
